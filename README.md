# Test git-crypt Performance

The need to store sensitive data along with code is quite common.
There are many tools that can help a dev with that.
This repo tests one of them [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).

Specially I was interested in how the performance would be in a very large
use case, with thousands of files.

My results: The performance was great as well as the usability.
Before using such a solution on prod, though, I would like to test further
for the reliability.
